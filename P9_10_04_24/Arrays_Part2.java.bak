		// Main points:
		/*
			1. Arrays in Java are treated as Objects.
			2. In Java memory for Objects is given in "HeapArea".
			3. If memory is given in "HeapArea", JVM will give default value for variables based on the datatypes. 
				* int, byte, short, long --> zero ( 0).
				* float, double --> 0.0
				* char --> nothing
				* boolean --> false

			4. If memory is given in "StackArea", programmer should initialize the value before using the variable, otherwise it would result in "CompileTimeError"
			5. While working with Arrays, below are the steps we need to follow:
				* Array Declaration		--> int [] a;
				* Array Construction	--> a = new int[23];
				* Array Initialisation	--> a[20] = 243;

			6. Any problem occured at runtime we categoriesd into 2 types:
				a. Exception => Problem occured and it can be handled.
				b. Error	 => Problem occured, but it can't be handled.

			*/

			// As we know that Arrays in Java are treated as Objects, then we need not to give new keyword below to construct an Arrays.
			// Below we are doing all three steps at once: Declaration, Construction, Initialization.
			int[] a = {10, 20, 40} ;
			System.out.println(a);

			for( int i =0; i<3 ; i++ )
				System.out.println(a[i]);
